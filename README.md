This is an analysis of Organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. The analysis uses Machine Learning and specifically Neural Networks to identify if the recipients will be successful in their endeavors. I have included three technical deliverables:

1. Preprocessing the data for a Neural Network Model.
2. Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
3. Optimize the model.


## Technologies

This analysis uses Python 3.7 with the following packages and libraries:

- Pandas

- Pathlib

- Tensorflow

- Sklearn


## Installation Guide

This analysis was done with Pandas in Google Colab. If the User wants to interact with the Machine Learning Model, first install the following:
  To get started using this application please go to [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and select the version for your operating system. Then install the following libraries and packages.

``` sudo apt install python3-pip ```. This will install the pip that will make it easier to install the libraries.

``` pip install pandas ```

``` pip install --upgrade tensorflow ```

``` pip install -U scikit-learn ```


## Usage

The file of interest is labeled ``` GC_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb ```
